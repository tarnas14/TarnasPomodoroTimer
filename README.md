# TarnasPomodoroTimer

Hi, this is Tarnas! :)

This is a constant work in progress - the interface will probably change daily.

This was created because I want to make as much mistakes as I can, so I am writing
very small projects.

  I am using a pomodoro timer when I'm trying to be productive and although I have searched
  far and wide I haven't found one that would be perfect for me. Thus, I set out to
  build my own and, hopefully, learn a thing or two on the way.
